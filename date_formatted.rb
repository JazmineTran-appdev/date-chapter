# Write a program to identify different parts of today's date.
# 
# It should work similarly to the following:
#
#   "The year is: 2022, the calendar day is: 1, and the month is: 7."
#
# Use exactly the same copy ("The year is...") as above in the output.
# but replace values using string addition or string interpolation.
# 
# Don't forget to:
#   
#    require "date"
